\chapter{Code issues}
This chapter makes explicit reference to both the provided checklist and the code fragments (included in \autoref{sec:code}).

\section{Main issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item Item 10 of the checklist is touched upon by the whole document: the brace styling is \emph{K\&R} and not the preferred \emph{Allman}, but the choice is otherwise consistent throughout;
\item Item 14 of the checklist is violated on line 265, method \texttt{processArchive()}, and lines 370 and 393, method \texttt{createResources()}: line length exceeds 120 characters;
\item Item 18 of the checklist is violated on line 370, method \texttt{create\-Resources()}, and line 414, method \texttt{createConfig()}: there is no attached Javadoc nor comment to explain what these methods do;
\item Item 34 of the checklist is violated on line 370, method \texttt{createResources()}: parameter \texttt{deployResources} is unused and should be removed;
\item Item 41 of the checklist is violated on line 301, method \texttt{processArchive()}: there is a spelling error in the exception string;
\item Item 52 of the checklist is violated on line 298, method \texttt{processArchive()}, and line 440, method \texttt{createConfig()}: general eceptions are caught instead of listing the specific ones.
\end{itemize}

\section{Other problems}
Methods \texttt{createResources()} (line 370) and \texttt{createConfg()} (line 414) have complex and deep nested structures that should maybe be simplified.
