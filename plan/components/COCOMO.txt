COST DRIVERS
===
Required Software Reliability
VERY LOW
0.82
At most one loses a taxi. Big deal.

Database Size
NOMINAL
1.00
By approximation: estimated SLOC are some thousands, and the four databases would be medium in size

Product Complexity
NOMINAL
1.00
Estimated on the CPLEX rating scale.

Required Reusability
NOMINAL
1.00
A modular structure is always good, but there is no need to overachieve.

Documentation match to life-cycle needs
NOMINAL
1.00
Other documents detail what and how should be done in enough detail.

Execution Time Constraint
HIGH
1.11
The system needs to constantly monitor coverage and handle requests.

Main Storage Constraint
n/a
Storage size is not an issue.

Platform Volatility
LOW
0.87
Assumed low since we can imagine a very stable work situation without frequent innovations

Analyst capability
HIGH
0.85
A lot of effort went into defining requirements and design.

Programmer Capability
NOMINAL
1.00
The team works well, but we don't have real experience.

Personnel continuity
VERY HIGH
0.81
If we did this, we'd probably do this ourselves and alone.

Application experience
VERY LOW
1.22
We never did anything of the sort (JEE, webapps, etc)

Platform experience
LOW
1.09
While we have been studying the theoretical workings of the components (databases, user interfaces, etc) we never actually used them anywhere in practice.

Language and tool experience
LOW
1.09
As stated above, manly

Usage of software tools
NOMINAL
1.00
Integrated Development Enviroments, dependencies managers, collaborative effort trackers and version controllers.

Multisite development
EXTRA HIGH
0.80
We worked together most of the time, in person, and communicated with today's means when needed.

Required development schedule
NOMINAL
1.00
We were always on time and the workload was always balanced.
