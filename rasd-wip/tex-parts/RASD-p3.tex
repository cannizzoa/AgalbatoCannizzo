\section{Non-functional requirements}

\subsection{Performance requirements}
\begin{itemize}

\item The system must support a certain number of terminals for taxi drivers that will be at first estimated and then extracted from a statistical analysis of the system usage in its first months of life;
\item The system must support a certain number of terminals for passengers that will be at first estimated and then extracted from a statistical analysis of the system usage in its first months of life;
\item The system must support the simultaneous use of 50\% of the registered passengers;
\item The system must support the simultaneous use of 100\% of the registered taxi drivers;
\item Taxi drivers notifications must be received in less than 5 seconds.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software system attributes}
Reliability is an important factor due to the fact that the system manages all taxis in the city, so if it were to fall the whole taxi circulation would be paralyzed. Portability must be considered top priority as the mobile application will need to run on all major mobile Operating Systems.

Security is less critical since no confidential client information are registered on or exchanged by the system.
