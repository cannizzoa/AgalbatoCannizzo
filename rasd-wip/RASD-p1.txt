+++ Introduction +++

++ Purpose ++
This is the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document for the project software My Taxi Service. The goal of this document is to describe the system in terms of goals, requirements, assumptions and design, to define the different classes of users that will interact with it, and to analyze its most typical and most critical use cases.

This document is targeted to the customer’s project managers, to evaluate the project specification from a high-level point of view, and to the intended designers, developers, programmers, analysts and testers, to build the actual software and to maintain, integrate and expand it in the future.

++ Scope ++
The aim of this project is to build a software system able to manage and optimize taxi services in a large city, targeted both to the city public transportation management council and to the citizens as customer of the taxi service. The system will allow passengers to use the service in a smart and accessible way, and at the same time will offer a better service thanks to an enhanced management of taxi resources and allocation.
