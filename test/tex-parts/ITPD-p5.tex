\chapter{Program stubs and testing data required}
Beyond the basic functionalities required to any stub (that is, providing a mock of the functions it is called upon to mimic so that the related component may be tested in safety), running integration testing suites on this project requires some implementation of the four databases that have been mentioned (Requests, City zones, Taxi and Taxi driver, Passengers). These should contain well-strctured and valid data, used by many components to test their own functionalities.

Follows a list of all the required stubs:
\begin{itemize}
\item stub uno
\item stub due
\item stub qualcosa
\end{itemize}
