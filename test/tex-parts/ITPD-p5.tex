\chapter{Requirements traceability}

To ensure requirements traceability we pointed out, for each of the requirements identified in the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document for this project, which architectural components (defined in \autoref{sec:architecture}) are involved in their satisfaction and implementation.
We omitted to explicitly include the \emph{Central Messenger} because it is involved in every functional requirement and we also omitted to explicitly include databases because we have already discussed their strict connection with components of the \emph{Business tier}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The system must balance taxi drivers workload by assigning each one to a \emph{first-in, first-out} queque in a city zone -- \textbf{Queque handler};

\item The system must provide a sign up function for passengers -- \textbf{Sign-Up Manager, Graphical User Interface};
\item The system must store all required passenger information -- \textbf{Sign-Up Manager};

\item The system must provide a log in function to access all passenger features -- \textbf{Log-In Manager, Graphical User Interface};

\item The system must provide a function that allows logged passengers to require a taxi -- \textbf{Request Gatherer, Graphical User Interface};
\item The system must provide a form in which the logged passenger will be able to add trip information for a request for service (starting point, destination point, number of passengers) -- \textbf{Request Gatherer, Graphical User Interface};
\item The system must retrieve GPS information from the logged passenger's mobile phone -- \textbf{GPS Reader};

\item The system must provide a reservation function -- \textbf{Request Gatherer, Graphical User Interface};
\item The system must provide a form in which the logged passenger will be able to add trip information for a reservation (starting point, destination point, number of passengers, leaving time) -- \textbf{Request Gatherer, Graphical User Interface};
\item The system must finalise a reservation two hours before its requested time, making it unchangeable -- \textbf{Request Allocator};
\item The system must store a reservation history for each passenger -- \textbf{Request Gatherer};
\item The system must provide a function which shows reservation history -- \textbf{Request Gatherer, Graphical User Interface};

\item The system must provide a function to allow logged passengers to modify a reservation up to two hours before the requested time -- \textbf{Request Gatherer, Graphical User Interface};
\item The system must provide a function to allow logged passengers to delete a reservation up to two hours before the requested time -- \textbf{Request Gatherer, Graphical User Interface};

\item The system must analyse a newly-made real time request and send a confirmation with the estimated waiting time if it can be fulfilled -- \textbf{Request Gatherer, Graphical User Interface};
\item The system must analyse a newly-made reservation request and send a confirmation if it can be fulfilled -- \textbf{Request Gatherer};

\item The system must notify passenger if his reservation cannot be met -- \textbf{Request Allocator, Graphical User Interface};
\item The system must delete all reservations in a passenger's history that cannot be met after sending him notice -- \textbf{Request Gatherer};

\item The system must provide a sign up function for taxi drivers -- \textbf{Sign-Up Manager, Graphical User Interface};
\item The system must store all required taxi driver information -- \textbf{Sign-Up Manager};
\item The system must check that all taxi drivers trying to sign up own both a valid taxi driver's license and a proper driver's license -- \textbf{Sign-Up Manager};
\item The system must check that the information needed for a taxi driver sign up points to a specific person in the company that has not already registered before confirming -- \textbf{Sign-Up Manager};

\item The system has to provide a log in function to access all taxi drivers features -- \textbf{Log-In Manager, Graphical User Interface};

\item The system must provide a function to allow logged taxi drivers to inform the system of their availability -- \textbf{Queue Handler, Graphical User Interface};

\item The system must notify taxi drivers of an incoming request for service -- \textbf{Request Allocator, Graphical User Interface};
\item The system must provide all necessary information for taxi drivers to carry out requests -- \textbf{Request Allocator, Graphical User Interface};

\item The system must provide a function to allow taxi drivers to confirm that they are going to take care of an assigned request for service -- \textbf{Request Allocator, Graphical User Interface};
\item The system must provide an explicit \emph{decline} function to allow taxi drivers to notify that they are not going to take care of an assigned request for service -- \textbf{Request Allocator, Graphical User Interface};
\item The system must flag a taxi driver as having declined an assignment if no answer is received within 30 seconds -- \textbf{Request Allocator};
\item The system must move a taxi driver that has declined an assignment at the end of their queue -- \textbf{Queue Handler};

\item The system must analyse taxi locations and calculate their best possible distribution -- \textbf{Coverage Manager};
\item The system must choose which taxi drivers need to be moved to ensure total coverage of the city -- \textbf{Coverage Manager};
\item The system must notify taxi drivers in which city zone they have to move, as needed -- \textbf{Coverage Manager, Graphical User Interface}.
