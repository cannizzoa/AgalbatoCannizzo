\chapter{Program stubs and testing data required}
Beyond the basic functionalities required to any stub (that is, providing a mock of the functions it is called upon to mimic so that the related component may be tested in safety), running integration testing suites on this project requires some implementation of the four databases that have been mentioned. These should contain well-strctured and valid data, used by many components to test their own functionalities.

Follows a list of all the required stubs:
\begin{itemize}					\item A stub for the App Central Messenger
							\item A stub for the App GPS Reader
							\item A stub for the Server Central Messenger
							\item A stub for the Log In Manager
							\item A stub for the Sign Up Manager
							\item A stub for the Request Allocator
							\item A stub for the Coverage Manager
							\item A stub for the Queue Handler
							\item A stub for the Request Gatherer
							\item A stub for the Passengers Database
							\item A stub for the Taxi Drivers Database
							\item A stub for the Requests Database
