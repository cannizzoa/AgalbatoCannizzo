\chapter{Tools and test equipment required}
Since a top-down approach has been used to plan the integration testing suites for the components, it is necessary to use a specific framework to not only create and run automated tests but also to build and manage the necessary components stubs. This said, \emph{Arquillian} looks like the perfect tool for the job, with support from \emph{JUnit}'s test cases and infrastructure. We reserve the possibility of using manual testing for the Graphical User Interface parts.

At this point in the process, we are exploring just the integration level of the several different possible test sequences. How the single units have been tested, and how the system as a whole will be tested, is not part of this document. Thus, no tools are indicated for those activities.
