\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose and scope}
This is the Integration Test Plan Document for the project software \mts{}. The goal of this document is to describe the system's required integration testing framework and infrastructure that ought to prove its compliance with specifications, starting from these and proceeding up to the design phase of the different testing procedures.

This document is targeted to the project testers, to correctly build their infrastructure so that the integration testing phase can proceed according to plan.

General information on the \mts{} project itself may be found in the reference documents, as specified below.

\section{Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Component: High level element of the architectural design phase. Components make up the structure of the system;
\item Module: Low level element of the architectural design phase. Modules join together to build a single component;
\item Stub: The typical integration testing element that works as a stand-in for other elements.
\end{itemize}
